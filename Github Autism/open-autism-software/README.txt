About:
------------------------------
Open Autism Software aims to design, develop, evaluate and distribute open source software for people diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). We believe the open source approach provides advantages in helping engage a highly-motivated community of parents and researchers while providing outcomes that are freely accessible. This is particularly important given the lack of free resources available to children and adults with ASD. In addition, our open source software targets commoditized hardware with the goal of making the technologies we develop as widely available as possible.

Drawing | Collaborative Storytelling
------------------------------------ 	 
Tell a visual story by drawing pictures. You can take turns passing the computer back and forth to add onto a story told through images you and your partner create. You can draw using the computer's pen, as well as zoom in and out, rotate the drawing, and shift it up or down.

Skills: Creativity, storytelling, fine motor skills, turn taking, sharing and collaborating, compromising one’s interests with the interests of others.


---------------------------------------
Music | Collaborative Music Composition
---------------------------------------
Create a music composition by turning on and off notes. Your selected notes are played when a bar moves across the screen, playing one column at a time. You can produce a chord by turning on two or more notes on the same column.. You can also make the music slower or faster, pause it, or clear the screen.

Skills: Creativity, fine motor skills, turn taking, sharing and collaborating.


----------------------------------------
Untabgle  
----------------------------------------
Solve a puzzle by untangling lines between circles. There are two versions of this game. The first has circles of one color, and the second has circles of two colors. The second version is intended to put players in situations where they need to coordinate and communicate if each is assigned one color of circles to move.

Skills: Practice verbal communication, coordination, cooperation, fine motor skills, turn-taking.
